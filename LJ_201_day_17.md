#Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 17

Whooo! Today we really made some serious headway with our project. We have every aspect of the gameplay working except for the ability for users to save a pending game. Risa even made a pretty big dent in the apps styling, so the finish line is in sight. I honestly didn't think we would be able to get much done today, but I think we all put in a solid 8 hours of coding and the results definitely reflect all of our hard work. Group work definitely does present its own unique struggles. It definitely isn't easy to have people working on three different tasks in tandum and then bring them together simultaneously, but I think we've managed to pull it off. Needless to say I'm excited to get this wrapped up tomorrow.
