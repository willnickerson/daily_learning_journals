#Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 11

Today's lab definitely through me in some circles. While I definitely walked away with some new JS methods, it was only because I spent a good amount of time running into walls without them. Regardless, I think it was a good experience despite the frustration, .indexOf and .getAttribute are definitely going to come in handy in the future.

Today was also the first time that I spent over half an hour developing user stories and working on psuedo-code. Writing out everything that I knew I needed to do and breaking those goals into smaller tasks really made the whole coding portion of the lab much easier. I can only imagine how much more frustration I would have felt if I had not taken the time to do that.
