#Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 12

Today's lab was a completely new experience. So far in the class we have placed a lot of importance on really understanding the code that we are writing as opposed to just going through the motions. However, today it was completely the opposite. In all honesty I really enjoyed it, and I think it helped me affirm that I don't need to completely understand the in and outs of something to use it effectively. Rather it is more important to understand the the functionality of a library and be able to take time and understand the documentation.

After working with this library, I'm definitely looking forward to 301 and all of the work with JQuery that we are going to do.
