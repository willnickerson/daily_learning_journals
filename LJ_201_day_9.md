#Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 9

I spent most of today's lab working on CSS and HTML. I did spend about half an hour restructuring my JS and making sure I didn't have any functions imbedded inside of other functions. For some reason i though that it would be best to wrap everything in my JS inside of a function. For reasons that became clear very quickly, this was not a good idea. Although my code ran perfectly, it was difficult to read and certain variables and function calls were more difficult than they should have been.

As far as styling my page goes, I feel a lot more confident with CSS and getting my page lay out the way that I envision it in my head. For the first time I am really starting to like the way my page looks!
