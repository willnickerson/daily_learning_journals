#LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Today I learned the importance of regularly making commits on the git repo. During the lab, I made at least six commits and this entire process got me a lot more comfortable interfacing with git and the terminal.

I also ran into some problems in JS with my logical operators. I made the assumption that they would behave the same way they do in mathematics, unfortunately that isn't so :( But now I know that a string always evaluates to true.

Lastly I realized that I have a long way to go as far as CSS is concerned, but I think it will be a fun process. The page I made to day is pretty hideous (intentionally so) but I love it nonetheless.
