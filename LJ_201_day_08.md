#Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 8

Today's lab really helped me solidify the reading from the previous night. I was feeling pretty overwhelmed by the amount of information in chapter six, but actually getting hands on practice with events made the subject more manageable. I did't run into many problems with the JS events, although I did have to restructure my code significantly because I wrapped to many functions inside of other functions and was unable to call on their variable later. There is still a good amount of work for me to do as far as reworking the structure of my code, but at the moment everything works as it should. Now time to go in on the front page!
