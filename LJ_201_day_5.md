#Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 5

I loved doing todays lab, it reminded me of everything that I loved about studying mathematics. However, it did also worry me. I love doing this kind of work and I get the impression that the majority of doing full stack development does not revolve around this kind of problem solving. It does raise questions about what kind of programming I would be happier doing in the future. I am interested in learning a language like c++ or python that is more math oriented. How I am going to proceed with this still remains to be determined

Also, I really enjoyed the curveball that the bug in the test file presented. Its a good reminder that the code is meant to fulfill the specs and not just satisfy the test. I did wonder whether is made more sense to alter the spec or the test.js, but after a little bit of rationalizing I realized the spec needed to come first.
