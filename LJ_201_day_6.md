#Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 6

Today's lab was definitely the most challenging yet. While I still found all of the JS to be fairly easy, I am still a little hazy on the document object modeling. However, I think this will come with time.

I did apply a bit of a personal stretch in my code, which was intended to allow you to run the render function multiple times, without having duplicate lists on the page. While this worked great when applied to only one store's sales, it caused problems when applied to the whole project. It's on the back burner for now, but I will definitely be fiddling with it later.

In other news, I really excited about where my styling for the front page is going. The image shadow on the fish looks pretty sweet. THANK GOD FOR STACKOVERFLOW!!!!!!
