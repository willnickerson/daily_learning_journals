#Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 18

Wow I can't believe that project week is almost over. Today was definitely trying in a lot of ways. The script for our main gameplay page got pretty convoluted and we had to do some pretty serious debugging. There definitely were some good lessons that came out of the experience. John taught me how to effectively use the debugger and break lines on the Chrome Dev Tools. Additionally today really did show me how many unplanned problems can arise in project at the last minute and how many corner cases aren't accounted for in the initial planning phases. By the end of the day we had a fully functioning app though! So needless to say, I'm pretty hyped for presentations tomorrow.
