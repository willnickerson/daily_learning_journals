  #LJ Code 201 - Day 1

Today I learned a lot about more effective workflow, especially in regards to using the console and key commands. Overall this has given me a better perspective on the importance of interfacing directly with the machine instead of a GUI.

My favorite part of the day was the lab, as this was the first time I had ever put JS into an html document. In the codeacademy courses they were kept completely separate, and now I am starting to see how they interface with one another. However, all the script we used in lab today was only visible to the user through the console and dialog boxes. I am assuming that the JS can also be used in the HTML elements and am curious to see how this will be done.
