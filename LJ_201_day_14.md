#Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 14

Wow the end of formal class really snuck up on me. It didn't really hit me how much ground we had covered until we met with our groups today and started to plan out our project. What initially seemed like an unsurmountable task (getting JS to play Yahtzee), turned out to be completely doable after we broke the problem into smaller pieces. I can only imagine trying to tackle this project three weeks ago and in retrospect its pretty amazing how much we've learned in this course. Needless to say I'm pretty stoked on the coming week!
