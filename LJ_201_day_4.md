#Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 4

Today I ran into my first merge conflict. While I was at first terrified by all of the long hexadecimal strings in inserted into my code, I think it was good that this happened early on. Now in the future, I know what this looks like and how to deal with it. Furthermore I learned how important it is to carefully read the messages that the terminal sends back (it actually told me there were merge conflicts and I made a commit). The whole experience also got me to understand more about the push pull process with git hub as well as forking. I now know that after I pull something, there is no need to commit again as my branch has all of the most recent commitments. Who knew!

Partner coding was also a good time. I think i'm starting to understand how cool of a resource github is and the magnitude of open source collaboration that exists there.
