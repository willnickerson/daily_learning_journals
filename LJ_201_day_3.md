#Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 3

Today's lab was much more challenging than the previous two, but in the best was imaginable. It really took me back to the CS course I took in college, which was much more focused on problem solving as opposed to design. Even though Java and JS are completely different languages, a lot of the problems we were faced with in the class revolved around designing games with for-loops and arrays. Doing this kind of work in JS is what I look forward to doing more of in this class.

It was also fun to make a quick pass at improving the CSS on my page. I discovered the image background and opacity attributes which I look forward to playing with in the future.
