#Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 10

Todays lab felt a lot more like parter coding than the previous partner coding lab. To the best of my knowledge, there was no way to avoid merge conflicts, which made the whole process a great lesson in git workflow. Furthermore, working with John taught me a bunch of cool git commands, so I would say today was productive on multiple levels.

I also really enjoyed the challenge of trying to replicate someone else's wire frame, and think I will try to apply a lot of those styling techniques to my Salmon Cookie webpage. That corner logo is pretty sweet!
