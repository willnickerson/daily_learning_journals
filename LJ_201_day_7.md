#Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 7

Today's lab was definitely a good lesson in the dangers of calling on properties of objects that have not yet been instanciated. I spent a long while trying to debug my code only to realize that all I needed to do was move my object instanciation further up the page. Consequently, today also taught me a lot about how to read console errors. 

So, while today's lab did result in a few frustrating moments, I think it did teach me some good coding practices. Furthermore, I felt that the problem domain readings we did were really applicable to today's work. I spend longer than I usually would have trying to conceptually work out how to resolve the problem, which resulted in the coding being much easier!
