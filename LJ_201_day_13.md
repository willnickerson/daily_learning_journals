#Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 13

I found working with local storage to be really interesting, especially after reading about the history of local storage and the limits that it presented for web applications. The actual work with local storage that we did to today and the scope was fairly small, but I can only imagine in the future when full fledged applications such as photoshop can be done entirely through the browser that the JSON strings someone would have to deal with could cause a lot more problems. Furthermore, after working with local storage today I am curious about what techniques we would use for remotely storing the page data. Especially since the project we are working on is a survey, I imagine it would make sense for the data also to be collecting somewhere.

I did also spend a good amount of time today on styling, and finally got the size of an image to increase when the cursor is hovering over it without moving all the other elements on the page. Needless to say, that was pretty exciting.
